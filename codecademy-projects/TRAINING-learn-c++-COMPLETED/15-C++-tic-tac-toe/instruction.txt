Tic-Tac-Toe

    Tic-Tac-Toe (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game.

Open-ended:

    This project is slightly different than the others you have encountered thus far. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended checkpoints. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Prerequisites:

    In order to complete this project, you should have completed the following sections of Learn C++:

    Loops
    Vectors
    Functions
    Make sure to plan out the program on paper before you start coding and remember to take breaks!

    You’ll need to account for the following:

    This game will have two players that will input in the same terminal.
    This 3x3 game board will need to be represented using a data structure, like a vector or an array.
    There are 8 winning combinations.

Project requirements:

    Loops: This program should use a for loop or while loop to iterate through the player turns.
    Vectors: This program should use a vector or an array to hold nine positions of the 3x3 grid.
    Functions: This program should be modular.
