Project Goals:
Create a C++ text adventure with the storyline of your choosing. The program should use your knowledge of C++ conditionals, logic, and loops.

Project Requirements:

R1 | DONE
Your program should have a storyline with:
    - a beginning
    - at least three possible endings
It can help to map out your ideas on paper and draw out your possible branches before you begin coding anything.

R2 | DONE
Your program should contain at least three branch points where the user must make a choice about what to do next. At each branch point, the program should:
    - give the user at least two choices
    - accept user input
Note that not every story branch needs its own ending; it can also add something and then reconnect with another storyline.

R3 | DONE
Your program should incorporate at least one kind of loop.
Loops come in handy in a couple scenarios:
    - to validate user input (e.g., check if the user entered something other than your listed choices and then list the choices again)
    - to give the user multiple chances to choose a specific outcome (e.g., give a user three chances to pick an option that won’t get them killed)
    - to continue the adventure until the user makes a particular choice
Note: On Codecademy’s platform, if you plan to obtain user input within a loop, we recommend sticking with a for loop. Due to the way our platform is set up, a while loop that includes user input will trigger an infinite loop.

R4 | DONE
Your program should handle user choices using conditional logic. We encourage you to use if/else if statements and switch statements where you see fit.
Note: If your user has reached an ending, you can use return 0; to exit the main() function and end the program.
