                <p class="execution">flex containers have two axes:<br>
                  - a main axis (by default, horizontal)<br>
                  - a cross axis (vertical)<br>
                  The main axis is used to position flex items with the following properties:<br>
                  - justify-content<br>
                  - flex-wrap<br>
                  - flex-grow<br>
                  - flex-shrink<br>
                  The cross axis is used to position flex items with the following properties:<br>
                  - align-items<br>
                  - align-content<br>
                  The main axis and cross axis are interchangeable. We can switch them using the flex-direction property.
