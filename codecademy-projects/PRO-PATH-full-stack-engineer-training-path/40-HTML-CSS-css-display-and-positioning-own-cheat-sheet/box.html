                  - horizontal margins (left and right), like padding, are always displayed and added together. For example, if two divs with ids #div-one and #div-two, are next to each other, they will be as far apart as the sum of their adjacent margins<br>

                  - it may be helpful to think of collapsing vertical margins as a short person trying to push a taller person - the tall person has longer arms and can easily push the short person, while the person with short arms cannot reach the person with long arms
